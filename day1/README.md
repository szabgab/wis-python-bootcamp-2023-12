## Notes

* We covered a bit about the course requirements and the end of semester project.
* We installed python from https://www.python.org/ .
* We fixed the lack of PATH issue.
* We ran python -V on the command line.
* We saw how to run python by typing in the full page (I think it was c:\users\USERNAME\anaconda3\python.exe ).
* We installed Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/ .
* We installed the Python plugin that provides IntelliSense.
* Created a folder for our code.
* Created our first Python program in VS Code. (Hello World)
* We ran it from the many and directly in the terminal of VS Code.
* We saw cd (change directory) and dir (list directory).
* We learned about TAB for autocomplete.
* Installed Jupyter by typing in pip install jupyter   ( see https://jupyter.org/ ).
* We started the Jupyter notebook by typing in jupyter notebook in the folder where we wanted our files. We managed to use it to print Hello World, but we could not stop it properly and could not restart it.
