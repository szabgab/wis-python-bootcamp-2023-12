## Notes

## 1st hour:
argv and the command line arguments


## 2nd hour:
* Installing tk
* Showing the Tk demo slides https://code-maven.com/slides/python/tk

* started with an "add" function, but then it was important to explain *why* we would like to have functions so we saw the implementation of Fibonacci
first as duplicate code and then as a function.

## 3rd hour:
* modules
* testing

`pip install pytest`

* function returning multiple values

## Assignment

Take the solution for the previous assignment you submitted, split it up into functions as you feel fit
make sure functions either do computation or do IO (Input output) meaning print or get input.
Don't put both computation and IO in the same function.

Then move the functions that do computation to a separate file - a module - and use them from the program.
Create a third file with several test to verify the functions in the module. Use these filenames:

* `compute_sequence.py`   - the main program
* `sequence.py`           - the module that only has functions
* `test_sequence.py`      - the tests.

Put all 3 files in a single folder and upload that folder to Dropbox.


## End of Semester Project

Originally I thought that we'll start doing the project after we finished the lessons, but our semester is short and you might have a lot of exams crammed together, so I'd like to suggest you start thinking
about your project. If you need help, reply to the message in which I sent you the grade. That's our one-on-one discussion. I can allocate some time during the week to have one-on-one conversations
about the project. I think it could help you if you already decided on a project and sent me the proposal. That way I can approve it earlier and you can start working on it during the semester.
