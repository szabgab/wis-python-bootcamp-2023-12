## Project

* You can do the project in pairs

### Proposal

* Create a github repository where the proposal (that becomes description) will be the README.md file You will open an issue on our shared project with a  link to that repo. (and I'll add the link to the README file.)
* The proposal should give me the feeling that you know what are the issues you are facing, but if something is unclear I'll ask. Some people do it in 5-10 lines, others write a whole paper. I prefer the shorter ones. At the end it should be the basis of the user documentation of your project.
* The name of the repo should to reflect what the code will do not "final_project".
* Add links to your web sites with your names.
* Include at least one input data file


### Project

* The project itself will have to come with test that uses sample input data files
* Open an issue on our shared project with a link to your repository when you'd like to submit the project.

### Project notes

* The Python dependencies of the project should be listed in a file called `requirements.txt`.
* There should be instructions in the README on how to set up the environment, how to install the dependencies, how to run the tests, how to prepare the input (if needed), and how to run the program.
* There should be a file called `.gitignore` listing all the folders and files you want to exclude from git to avoid adding them accidentally.
* All the code should be in functions, even if there is a function called `main`. Functions should be short (20-40 lines max).
* On Windows filenames are case insensitive meaning `Examle.txt` and `example.txt`, on Linux, and I think also on macOS they are different. Make sure your code works on Linux as well.

* Before you submit the project to me, find someone who also participates in the course (but not in your project) and ask that person to check out your project without giving them any extra explanation. If after reading the README they still have questions, then answer those questions by updating the README.
* When you want to submit the project, please open a new issue in this repository with a link to the project. Then there is no need to send me emails.


### Project dead-line
